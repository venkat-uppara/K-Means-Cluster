## Problem Statment :
  ## The Data is avaliable for 3 years ie 12 Quarters .Please use the fourth month data to create a cluster and track the progress of the cluster across the months 
#### Task 1: Subset the data for the first three months
#### Task 2: K Elbow ( on first 3 months data )
#### Task 3: K Means ( Create Clusters )
#### Task 4: Visualize the clusters ( Create Clusters )(Sample of observations)
#### Task 5: The clusters formed in the step 3 needs to be tracked across next 30 Quarters
#### Task 6: If there is decline inform key stakeholders about the KPIs. If, there is a continous increse or steady sales...Continue the activities
